## Welcome 👋



Code runs our world.

Yet code isn't written for computers.

We write code because we are human beings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;imbued with ideas, imagination and feelings.<br/>
Code expresses our thoughts made digital:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a medium for our values, cultures and ways of life.

If you knew code, what would _you_ create?

For those who venture into the world of code<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;will be the ones creating our futures.

What will _your contribution_ be..?

The only way to find out, **is to try**.
